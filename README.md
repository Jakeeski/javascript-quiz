# javascript-quiz

- This quiz was created using my knowledge of HMTL, CSS, and JS. The quiz should allow the user to answer 5 questions, being notified if they're right or wrong, while a timer counts down. At the end of the quiz, the user will be able to save their data and score.

# Objectives

- Create a quiz for users
- Each question comprised of 4 options, with one of them being correct.
- When a question is answered correctly, it will give points.
- When a question is answered incorrectly, it will deduct time from timer.
- If timer reaches 0, or 5 questions have been answered, game ends.
- When the game is over, you can enter your initials and save your score.

# Challenges

- This was a really tough challenge. It was a learning experience in a lot of ways. One of the biggest struggles, was local storage, and getting the highscores to display correctly at the end of the game. I chose to do the multiple page way of thinking, rather than having display hidden in JS, and that gave me an opportunity to try linking different types of files. I watched several youtube videos for inspiration, got help from several people in class and my professor and TA's, and even had some tutor help. There was a lot of different ways of thinking that went into this project, and therefore this got very confusing at the end. All in all it was a fun project and I'm glad I learned what I did.
